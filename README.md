# HTTP-server-and-client-using-socket-API
 Implementation of an HTTP client and server running a pared down version of HTTP/1.0. This project is coded in python.


PROGRAM DESIGN:
•	The HTTP client and server are implemented using python programming language. 
•	The python version used is 3.6.0
•	The python’s socket and request modules are used to build the server.

HTTP Server:
•	Server is initialized in the beginning.
•	A method for server to launch on a specified port is defined.
•	The number of concurrent requests the server can support is set to 3 in the get_request method.
•	The server is set around an infinite loop and needs to be interrupted with a terminal signal before it stops.
•	The type of HTTP request method is identified using the socket request. Then, it will parse the input and serve the request accordingly.
•	If server receives a GET request, then it sends out HTTP version:1.0, status code: 200, response phrase: OK to the client. It displays the content of that file.
•	If server receives a PUT request, it saves the file as test.txt and on successful creation of this file, server responds to the client with “200 OK File Created” message.

HTTP Client: 
•	The client can invoke either the local server or any of the intranet servers for either sending files to those servers or receiving files from them. 
•	The client can send/receive files to/from local server, but for the real web servers, files can only be received/ retrieved from them. 
•	The client cannot upload a file on the real web servers.
•	The requests sent here are http requests and have a specific format. For any other request than the valid http request, the server does not respond. 

To run the HTTP server and Client:

Step1: Run the server
•	Server: runserver.py 8080   (8080 is the port reserved by the server for a client connection)

Step2: Execute the client using GET method to retrieve file
Step3: Execute the client using PUT method to upload file


•	Client: Test cases
      client.py 127.0.0.1 8080 GET index.html
      client.py www.cnn.com 80 GET index.html
      
      
HTTP Request methods: The HTTP request methods implemented in this program are as following.
•	GET: GET request indicates that the client wants to retrieve a file from the server specified. 
•	PUT: PUT request indicates that the client wants to upload a file to the server specified.
